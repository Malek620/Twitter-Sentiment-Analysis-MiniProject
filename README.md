# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-MiniProject
We present here a Machine learning solution treating a NLP probleme which is how to detect hate speech in tweets (more specifically, racist/sexist speech) ??? 

in training dataset csv file we have samples of tweets and their own labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist we provide also in another separate csv file the test set 

This mini-project includes: 

Tweets Preprocessing and Cleaning

Exploring and visualizing the tweets data using WordCloud to underst the common words used in the tweets

Extracting Features from Cleaned Tweets using 3 different thechniques : Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec  

Trying to choose the best model between Support Vector Machine(SVM) and XGBoost using the last 3 features extraction methods that we have already seen 

and Finally some Hyperparameters Tuning to improve our model
